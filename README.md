# Team-Manager-Profile-Generator

## Description
This project was created in order to be able to quickly create a basic HTML page filled with the information contained in a team roster. User input is taken from the command line and used to create a custom HTML file complete with bootstrap styling to display the team that was inputted. During development, I learned how to use javascript to generate a fairly complex HTML page with references to a number of object classes within it. I also learned how to use jest to test if a program is working correctly during development.

## Installation
Clone or copy the repository into a local system, from there you can run 'npm i' in the console to install dependencies. After that you can run the program and follow the prompts to generate a team roster HTML page.

## Usage
Open the console of your system or Git Bash, navigate to the folder containing the program. Type 'node index' into the command line. Follow the prompts, adding the manager information, as well as the information for all team members. A confirmation will be logged to the console when the HTML file is created. Your generated HTML file can be found in the 'dist' folder of the cloned project. Below is a link to a walkthrough of the workflow.
